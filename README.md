# Flutter navigation with provider


## What is this about ?

I was messing around learning how to use provider when i got the idea to do simple navigation with provider

### has this been done before ? 

Probably but i didn't bother to check

## How do i test it ?
 - clone repo and run `flutter create .` to add android, ios and web directories


 ## demo:
 <div style="align:center"><img src="assets/demo.gif" height="790"></div>
